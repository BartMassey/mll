neuron.c is a "neuron": a perceptron classifier.  hamming.c
is a minimum hamming distance voting classifier.  dtree.c is
an ID3 decision tree classifier.  nbayes.c is a naive bayes
classifier.  The Makefile will build these.

Instances files for input to these programs are formatted
starting with a line containing number of instances and
number of features.  Succeeding lines contain a message
identifier, a classification (-1 = "real", 1 = spam), and
then a bit vector of features.  Dictionary files containing
a mapping between feature number and feature name are a
useful adjunct to all of this.  The dictionary and instance
files can produced using software elsewhere in this
distribution
